/* This file imports Tailwind CSS's core styles and utilities.
 * It's needed because Tailwind CSS works by scanning your code and generating
 * the necessary CSS classes on-demand. These directives tell Tailwind what to include.
 *
 * @tailwind base - Adds base styles and resets (like margins, padding, typography)
 * @tailwind components - Adds component classes for building reusable UI components
 * @tailwind utilities - Adds utility classes for styling (like flex, p-4, text-center)
 *
 * Without this file, Tailwind's classes won't be available in your application.

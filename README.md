# PhysioEngine for React

PhysioEngine is a scalable React-based web application designed to streamline the collection, scoring, and analysis of physiotherapy questionnaires. The platform is built with modularity in mind, allowing for easy addition of new questionnaires and tools (through the backend) as it evolves.

## Core Features

### 1. For Physiotherapists

- Generate QR codes for any available questionnaire
- Track questionnaire completion in real-time
- View, analyze, and get a nice text copy/paste of the results
- Access results in an intuitive, visual format

### 2. For Patients

- Scan the QR code that is generated by the physiotherapist
- Complete forms in Swedish (with future support for additional languages)
- Submit responses wich seamlssy syncs to the physiotherapist computer screen

## Modular Design for Growth

- Dynamic Questionnaires: The system can support an unlimited number of questionnaires by dynamically rendering them from structured .ts files. This ensures flexibility for future tools
- Tool Expansion: The platform is designed to accommodate additional features like educational resources, and interactive calculators for PT tests and the like
- APIs for Integration: Future APIs can integrate with external systems (nothing planned yet)

## Supported Questionnaires (Current Examples)

- KOOS: Knee injury and osteoarthritis
- HOOS: Hip disability and osteoarthritis
- DASH: Disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand
- etc.

## Key Design Principles

- Component-Based Architecture: Each feature, like QR code generation or questionnaire forms, is encapsulated in reusable React components.
- Real-Time Updates: Built with state management libraries like Redux or Context API to handle live updates seamlessly.
- Scalability: The backend structure supports dynamic loading of questionnaires and tools, ensuring the site grows without compromising performance.

## Enhanced User Experience

- Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile use.
- Accessibility: Focused on usability with clear navigation, keyboard support, and readable layouts.
